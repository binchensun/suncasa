Welcome to SunCASA's documentation!
===================================

SunCASA is a Python wrapper around `CASA <https://casa.nrao.edu>`_ for importing, calibrating, synthesis imaging and visualizing solar spectral imaging data. CASA is one of the leading software tools for supporting the data post-processing needs of the next generation of radio astronomical telescopes such as ALMA and VLA, an international effort led by the `National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) <https://public.nrao.edu>`_. The current version of CASA uses Python 3.6
to 3.8 on most of the platforms. More information about the compatibility of CASA can be found on `this web page <https://casadocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/introduction.html#Compatibility/>`_.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including :ref:`installation` of the project.
